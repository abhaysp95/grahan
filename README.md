# Grahan

A simple regex based utility tool made to learn more about how regex works and regex based tools work internally.

### üìñ Learnings

Here are something the things which I learned:

* Match literals
* Match for +ve character class
* Match for -ve character class
* Match combination of character classes
* Match for start of string anchor
* Match for end of string anchor
* Match for one or more time
* Match for zero or one time
* Match for wildcard
* Match alternation
* Capture groups and backreferences (multiple)

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

The project is built in `Rust` language. I'm genuinly enjoying the going through the experiencing of learning and using rust simultaneously.

There are lots of benefits of using rust, but it comes with steep learning curve and projects like these are great way to learn a language like Rust.

The following project was done as part of **Codecrafters** challenge. You can read more about the codecrafters from below.

This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview).

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way
we'll learn about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
